Notes for Emergence
Goal: A multiplayer game where everything is emergent. Everything is either user designed/scripted or evolves through genetic algorithms. The majority of objects in the game are highly scriptable.


Asteroids

Gameplay exists within a circular mining net
Asteroids float from outside the circle inwards of random sizes, random shapes,random velocities.
Asteroid size and shape is derived from randomly determined “health” of an asteroid
Asteroids bounce back inside if they hit the edge of the circle coming from inside the circle
Lasers reduce asteroid health and consequently scale.
When an asteroid’s health expires it is destroyed and mineral dust is created.
Mineral dust floats at the velocity the asteroid had until it reaches mining net edge.
Mineral dust that reaches mining net edge will harvest the dust and score resources for the player(s) that setup the net.

Ship Operation

Thrust forward: ship increases thrust forward up to a maximum value determined by the engine
Thrust backwards: ship increases thrust backwards up to a maximum value determined by the engine
Rotate left: ship rotates left at a rate determined by the wings
Rotate right: ship rotates right at a rate determined by the wings
Fire laser: ship fires a laser out of its nose.

Lasers

Lasers move at a constant velocity set by the ship’s velocity combined with weapon force on firing.
Lasers exit the mining net
Lasers reduce asteroid health by their power when they collide
Lasers collide with ships and damage that ship as well as pushing the ship
